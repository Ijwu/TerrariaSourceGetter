# Terraria Source Getter

A shitty useless tool to get compilable decompiled terraria server source code by one click.  
It's a (temporary) alternative of our poor nuked [Sources](https://github.com/Pryaxis/Sources) repo.  

## Usage

Download the artifact in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TerrariaSourceGetter/actions) and run it, it's all.   
Or you can pass a path argument to decompile a specific terraria assembly (you can drag'n'drop if you have desktop environment).
